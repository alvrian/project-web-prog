### About FarmByte
![Logo](CORN-1.png.png)

Welcome to **FarmByte**, an innovative platform designed to create a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem by connecting **farmers**, **compost producers**, and **restaurants**. Our application promotes responsible consumption and production, aligning directly with **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**, which emphasizes efficient resource use, waste reduction, and sustainable practices.

#### How FarmByte Works:
1. **Restaurants**:
   - Restaurants can deposit kitchen waste into the platform, reducing food waste and contributing to eco-friendly practices.
   
2. **Compost Producers**:
   - Compost producers process the deposited waste into high-quality compost, which is then sold to farmers as an organic fertilizer.
   
3. **Farmers**:
   - Farmers use the compost to grow fresh, sustainable produce, which they sell directly to restaurants, completing the circular ecosystem.

#### Connection to SDG 12:
FarmByte embodies **SDG 12** by promoting:
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Transforming waste into valuable compost reduces reliance on chemical fertilizers.
- **Waste Reduction**: Encouraging restaurants to repurpose kitchen waste.
- **Sustainable Practices**: Supporting local farmers and reducing the carbon footprint of food production and supply chains.

By fostering collaboration between these roles, FarmByte not only enhances sustainability but also builds a community that prioritizes environmental responsibility and economic empowerment. Together, we are creating a future where every step of the supply chain supports a greener planet.
